# LeetCodeStuff

This is a collection of my implementations of algorithmic and data structures problems, which I considered interesting on the popular LeetCode coding platform.

The main goal of this repository is improvement both my Java8 and algorithmic thinking skills.

 The most important problems: 
 
 - Operations on Java Arrays
 - Operations on Strings and String Builders
 - Linked Lists
 - Application of HashMaps
 - Taking care about memory and time optimization issues
